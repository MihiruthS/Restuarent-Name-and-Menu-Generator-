# Cuisine to Restaurant and Menu Generator

This project is a simple LLM (Language Model) application that generates a restaurant name and a menu based on a given type of cuisine. Initially, the Google PaLM API was used, but the final application utilizes the OpenAI API.

## How It Works

Provide a type of cuisine, and the application will return:
1. A restaurant name.
2. A sample menu for the given cuisine.
